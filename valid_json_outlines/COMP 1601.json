  "Course Description": "This course uses an appropriate, contemporary programming language as a tool to teach fundamental programming concepts, topics and techniques. The main concepts covered are sequence, selection and repetition logic, character and string manipulation, functions, and a basic introduction to arrays and their applications.",
  "Rationale": "This course equips first year undergraduate students with the skills to solve problems on computer based systems. It identifies what type of problems can be solved by such systems and which cannot.  The focus in this course is problem description, definition and presentation using either flowcharting or pseudocode tools. By guiding students towards developing structured algorithms using well known methods and techniques, the course lays the foundation for building competency in programming.",
  "Course Aims": "This course aims to provide an introduction to programming. The course teaches students how to implement algorithmic solutions for common problems and tasks. Students are exposed to a contemporary programming language and learn how to write, test and debug programs.",
  "Course Learning Outcomes": [
    "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:",
    "Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process.",
    "Discuss how a problem may be solved by multiple algorithms, each with different properties.",
    "Create algorithms for solving simple problems.",
    "Use a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems.",
    "Analyse and explain the behaviour of simple programs involving the fundamental programming constructs variables, expressions, assignments, I/O, control constructs, functions, parameter passing, and recursion.",
    "Identify, describe and write programs that use primitive data types.",
    "Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions.",
    "Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, the definition of functions, and parameter passing.",
    "Write a program that uses file I/O to provide persistence across multiple executions.",
    "Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task.",
    "Describe the concept of recursion and give examples of its use.",
    "Identify the base case and the general case of a recursively-defined problem."
