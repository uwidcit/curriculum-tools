  "Mode of Delivery": "Face-to-Face ☐     Blended ☑     Online ☐",
  "Course Description": "This course provides the student with an introductory understanding of the terminology and concepts of operating systems, computer architecture, and computer networking. The technical foundation of operating systems’ installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting are introduced to students. The course will be delivered using a combination of face-to-face lectures and interactive hands-on computer lab sessions, along with eLearning activities using various online resources.  There are 5 units in this course: Unit 1: Hardware and Computer Architecture, Unit 2: Operating System Concepts, Unit 3: Operating Systems in Practice, Unit 4: System Administration, Unit 5: Network Operating System Concepts. Assessments will take the form of written examinations, practical lab examinations and a group project. This course has 100% coursework and no final written exam.",
  "Rationale": "A computer platform generally refers to the operating system and computer hardware only.  Operating systems are central to all computing activities and act as intermediaries between computer users and a computer’s hardware and software. Computer platforms however conform to a set of standards that enable software developers to produce software applications for specific platforms. This course therefore bridges the knowledge gap between how computer platforms work with all other software systems and application code to produce a working environment for users. It merges theoretical content with practical, real-world application of computer platforms in business settings. It also prepares students for further courses on computer systems such as computer networks.",
  "Course Aims": "INFO 2603 aims to develop practical operating system administration, management and troubleshooting skills in undergraduate students while promoting an understanding of the theory behind these operations relevant to computer architecture and networking concepts. This addresses the need for students to be able to configure and manipulate basic computer systems for a variety of platforms with a clear understanding of the implications of these tasks for business setting",
  "Course Learning Outcomes": [
    "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:",
    "Examine the basic hardware, computer architectures and machine organisations used by modern operating systems.",
    "Discuss operating system concepts, design objectives and principles using abstractions, layers and APIs",
    " Analyse flavours of operating systems and evaluate features that meet the needs of a business in different scenarios.",
    "Design an installation strategy for operating systems, the features and software to ensure the most economical use of hardware resources and time using a hypervisor. ",
    "Configure an operating system, its settings and features so that it can perform specific tasks for a user using virtual machines.",
    "Diagnose errors and problems with computers and the network to ensure the systems are available at all times.",
    "Perform administration of an operating system allowing ongoing user access to the required resources on a network.",
    "Utilise command line environments to manage file and directories, and perform administrative tasks in order to increase administrative performance.",
    "Analyse how hardware developments have led to changes in the priorities for the design and the management of file systems and data storage",
    "Conduct research necessary to successfully complete an assigned project on a cutting-edge topic area in Computer Science/Information Technology as applied to a business",
