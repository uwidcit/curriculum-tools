  "Course Description": "This course uses an appropriate programming language as a tool to teach intermediate programming concepts. The main concepts covered are structures, one and two dimensional arrays and applications involving searching, sorting and merging, random number generation, numerical methods, games and simulation.",
  "Rationale": "This course introduces new programming concepts. It focuses on the use of common searching and sorting methods and character and string manipulation which are two very important concepts that are necessary in most software systems.",
  "Course Aims": "This course aims to introduce students to intermediate programming concepts.This course teaches students the foundations of modeling, searching, sorting, and handling multi-dimensional data. Mastery of these essential topics in Computer Science allows students to extend the capabilities of a given programming language to meet the needs of a specific problem.",
  "Course Learning Outcomes": [
    "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:",
    "Implement basic numerical algorithms.",
    "Implement simple search algorithms and explain the differences in their time complexities.",
    "Apply Bayes’ rule to determine the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.",
    "Explain how conditional independence assertions allow for greater efficiency of probabilistic systems.",
    "Use random number generation in simulation and game development.",
    "Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the fundamental programming constructs variables, expressions, assignments, I/O, control constructs, functions, parameter passing, and recursion.",
    "Discuss the appropriate use of built-in data structures.",
    "Describe common applications for each of the following data structures: stack, queue, priority queue, set, and map.",
    "Design programs which utilize one and two-dimensional arrays.",
    "Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, records/structs, and strings.",
