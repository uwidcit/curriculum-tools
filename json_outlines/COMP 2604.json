  "Course Description": "This course looks at the inner workings of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X, both from a theoretical algorithmic point of view as well as a practical system programming point of view. The student will be introduced to the fundamental algorithms that support the existence of contemporary operating systems. Topics include the important areas of processes, threads, and CPU management, main and virtual memory management, file systems, disk scheduling algorithms, protection and security. This course will be delivered using a combination of lectures, blended learning, case studies, labs and various online resources. Assignments will take the form of written examinations, lab examinations, algorithm implementation and online assignments.",
  "Rationale": "An operating system acts as the interface between software applications and computer hardware and therefore is an essential course to Computer Science. This course presents important topics of operating systems such as structures of computer hardware and OSs, processes, threads, concurrency, CPU scheduling algorithms, primary and virtual memory, page replacement algorithms, file systems, disk scheduling algorithms, protection, and security. The course prepares students for other courses such as Computer Networks and Distributed Systems.",
  "Course Aims": "Operating Systems is to provide a user-friendly and convenient environment. Students are expected to learn and grasp the concepts of Operating Systems, as well as get expertise in how they operate as an intermediate between hardware and users, allowing users to access and utilise other resources more easily to manage a computer system's resources. ",
  "Course Learning Outcomes": [
    "On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:",
    "Describe how an operating system manages multiple processes on a single-CPU system",
    "Analyze the procedure involved in context switching",
    "Explain the advantages and disadvantages of inter-process communication (shared memory and message passing)",
    "Analyze available solutions for how deadlocks can arise in a system",
    "Examine virtual memory management systems using standard and inverted page tables",
    "Examine a variety of page replacement algorithms",
    "Describe the structure of a hard disk and the basic file system formats",
    "Describe how access to resources is controlled by the operating system",
    "Write programs to create, control and destroy processes and threads",
    "Write programs that use semaphores for critical region control, as well as for synchronization",
    "Write programs for inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory and message passing on UNIX systems, Win32 API, and Java API",
